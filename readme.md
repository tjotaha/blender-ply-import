# readply - a Python extension module for fast(er) import of PLY files in Blender

The default PLY importer in Blender is quite slow when it comes to 
import large mesh files. Most Python-based importers suffer from this
because during import Python data structures are built up holding all 
geometry, vertex colors, etc. This simply takes quite a lot of time 
(and memory). 

Fortunately, Python objects that support the buffer protocol can be
passed in certain places of the Blender Python API.
We can use this functionality to pass chunks of memory containing
vertex and face data, without having to build up Python data
structures. We use NumPy arrays in the `readply` extension module 
to easily pass the data directly to Blender. 

Example usage:
```
$ blender [<scene.blend>] -P mesh_readply.py -- myfile.ply
```

Notes: 

- The `readply` module is not tied to Blender in any way and can 
  be used as a general PLY reader in Python.
- Compared to 2.7 the 2.8x version of Blender already improves on the
  import time in the example below. Memory usage in 2.8x also improved 
  substantially. But the speed improvement using this module is still 
  of the same order (roughly 6x). 
- There was a [Google Summer of Code 2019 project](https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gsoc-2019-fast-import-and-export/7343) for creating new
  faster Blender importers for PLY, STL and OBJ. The results unfortunately
  do not seem to be merged with mainline Blender at the moment.
  If that ever happens this module will probably become obsolete as
  far as its use in Blender is concerned.
- Development and testing is done on Linux, but the module should compile
  and work under different operating systems

## Performance

Below are some numbers when importing the Asian Dragon model [1] from 
The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository [2]. This 3D model consists of
3,609,600 vertices and 7,219,045 triangles.

With Blender 2.81 and `xyzrgb_dragon.ply` already in the filesystem cache:

```
# Native blender PLY importer (bpy.ops.import_mesh.ply())
$ blender -P test/blender_native_import.py -- xyzrgb_dragon.ply
total                           43.538 sec

# mesh_readply.py using readply extension module
$ blender -P mesh_readply.py -- xyzrgb_dragon.ply
reaply():                        0.631s
blender mesh+object creation:    5.226s
total                            5.857s
```

I.e. in this test the `mesh_readply.py` script (which uses the `readply`
module) loads the Dragon model 7.4x faster into Blender than 
Blender's own PLY import script.

## Building

A `setup.py` script is provided to build the extension, either under
regular Python or with Blender's included version of Python. 

Note that for Blender usage it is advised to build and install the module using
Blender's Python version, as that will take care of placing the module
in the correct location.

### Blender

Note: the official Blender binaries do not include the Python headers. 
So you still need a full Python installation somewhere to build the 
`readply` extension.

Run the `setup.py` script with Blender's copy of
the Python interpreter. There should be a `python3.7m` executable in
your Blender directory. For example, for 2.81 on Linux the Python binary
is located at `<blender-dir>/2.81/python/bin/python3.7m`. Then run

```
$ <blender-dir>/2.81/python/bin/python3.7m setup.py install
```

If you get an error regarding the `setuptools` module not being found,
then run `.../python3.7m -m ensurepip` which should install the
`pip` module, followed by installing the `setuptools` module.

An alternative way is to run the setup script under Blender:

```
$ blender -b -P setup.py
```

### General Python

There's at least two options:

```
# Build the module, then copy it to the top-level directory
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

or

```
# Build the module, then copy it to the default Python module location
# (which might be a system-wide directory)
$ python setup.py install
```

## Notes

- Make sure that the version of NumPy used for compiling the readply
  extension has the same API version as the one that is used by Blender
  (the official binary distributions of Blender include a version of NumPy)
- The `readply` extension module can be compiled for both Python 2.x and 3.x,
  even though Blender uses Python 3.x
- Texture coordinates may be stored in s+t or u+v vertex fields, depending
  on what property names the PLY file being read uses

## Bugs

- The module is currently not usable as a drop-in replacement of the
  built-in PLY import in Blender
- It is assumed that if the PLY file includes vertex coordinates they 
  are defined in x, y and z order (the PLY header allows properties in any order).
